## Introduction to R
### Arithmetic with R
In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Exponentiation: ^
* Modulo: %%
  
The last two might need some explaining:

- The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
- The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.
### What's that data type?
You can check the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the `class()` function
